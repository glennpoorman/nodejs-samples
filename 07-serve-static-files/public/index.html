  <h1>Serving Up Even More</h1>
  <div class='my-paragraph'>
    Most websites are way more than just 'index.html'. This page, for example, uses
    the link tag to reference an external style sheet <i>styles.css</i>, uses the
    script tag to reference an external JavaScript file, and uses several img tags to
    reference several jpg images. Each of these tags will result in an additional
    GET request sent to the server for the contents of the referenced file. With that
    in mind, this server is written to handle several different types of files.
    <br><br>
    The overall look of the site is controlled by the style sheet. The digital clock
    below is controlled by some client side JavaScript. The images, of course, are
    external files.
