  <h1>A Better Server</h1>
  <p>
    This server is a bit more realistic in that it serves up the contents of an HTML
    file in response to the initial GET request. This removes any and all specific data
    from the server code leaving the code to simply blindly serve up files and leave the
    contents and their display in the hands of the author and client.
