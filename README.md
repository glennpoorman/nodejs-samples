# NodeJS Samples

These samples provide an overview of writing server code using JavaScript in the Node environment. The samples start at with the absolute basics starting with the proverbial "Hello World!" app and then slowly adding to the point where you have a functioning (albeit simple) web app.

These samples ultimately end up providing both server and client side work although the focus is mostly on server side JavaScript in the Node environment.

## Getting Started

To get started, you have to install NodeJS. Point your browser to http://www.nodejs.org, download the latest stable version, and then install.

From there, please review the README.txt file in the top level folder and then start going through the numbered samples. Each sample contains a README.txt file describing what the sample does and the files that were added/changed from the previous sample. That will help you skip right to the good stuff. The details are heavily commented in the code.

## Prerequisites

These samples assume some knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Lastly

I started this for my own benefit and don't claim to be an expert. Plus it appears that this is an area under constant growth and change and things can become outdated fast. If you have any suggestions for improvement or find any errors, don't hesitate to let me know.
